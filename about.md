Welcome to Tanglee's blog. You may also encounter some of my other nicknames, such as [tl2cents](https://github.com/tl2cents), [IcingMoon](https://cryptohack.org/user/IcingMoon/).


I aim to publish more content in English. If you find any errors or have suggestions, please feel free to contact me via [email](caxulasaela@outlook.com) or through other social media platforms (`tl2cents` on discord).

## CTF Stuff

I am a CTF player, primarily focusing on cryptography and blockchain. I represent [Never Stop Exploiting](https://nese.team/) (abbreviated as NeSE) in most international CTF competitions. Previous writeups of mine can be found on [tl2cents's blog](https://tl2cents.github.io/)—most of which are written in Chinese. I am considering migrating some of these write-ups here ~~if I have time~~.

## Edu. & Research

I got my bachelor's degree in Information Security from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) between 2018 and 2022.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Information Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests include zero-knowledge proofs, blockchain security, and applied cryptography. My main research focus is on zk-SNARKs and their applications in blockchain technology.

## Miscellaneous

Previously, I was enthusiastic about Genshin Impact, and my favorite character is [Yoimiya](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/inazuma?char=2). At present, I dedicate more time to programming and travelling. Still, I play some games occasionally including [Maj-soul](https://www.maj-soul.com/), [Palworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/), and [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/).
