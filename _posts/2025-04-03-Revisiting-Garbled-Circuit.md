The writeup of DiceCTF 2025 involves only section [elementary-optimizations](#elementary-optimizations) and section [free-xor-offset-leak-attack](#free-xor-offset-leak). Readers familiar with the garbled circuit can skip to the final [section](#free-xor-offset-leak). For those who are not familiar with free-XOR techniques, reading the section [elementary-optimizations](#elementary-optimizations) is enough to understand the final attack. For those who are interested in the half-gate technique of fancy-garbling library, reading section [half-gate-technique](#half-gate-technique) is recommended.

## Garbled Circuit

**Garbled circuit** is a type of **cryptographic protocol** that enables **secure computation** between two untrusting parties. In this setup, the parties can jointly evaluate a function on their **private inputs** without the need for a trusted third party. In the **garbled circuit protocol**, the function to be evaluated is usually represented as a **boolean circuit** consisting of gates (such as AND, OR, and NOT). The protocol ensures that each party learns only the output of the function and nothing about the other party’s input. A necessary component in garbled circuit is the **oblivious transfer (OT)** protocol.

### Oblivious Transfer

Alice has **two secret strings** $ S_0 $ and $S_1$. Bob chooses an private index $ i \in \{0, 1\} $. In **oblivious transfer (OT)**, the selectable string $S_i$ is transmitted between the **sender (Alice)** and the **receiver (Bob)** in the following manner:  

- **Bob learns nothing** about the unchosen string $ S_{1-i} $.  
- **Alice remains unaware** of Bob’s choice $ i $.  

It’s important to note that although Bob does not know the actual values of $ S_0 $ and $ S_1 $ beforehand, in practical applications, **Bob typically has some encoded/side-channel information** about these strings. This ensures that **Bob can intelligently decide** which message to retrieve rather than selecting blindly. For example, Alice usually sends the encrypted secret $c_0 = E(S_0), c_1 = E(S_1)$ in a sequential manner. This selective knowledge prevents Bob from making a random choice and allows for meaningful interaction in the protocol.  

**Oblivious transfer** is a fundamental cryptographic primitive used in protocols such as **secure multi-party computation (MPC)**, **fair blind signature**, and **zero-knowledge proofs**, enabling secure and private data exchange without compromising the privacy of either party.


### Process of Garbled Circuit

We describe the general process of garbled circuit protocol between Alice (known as garbler) and Bob (known as evaluator) with their private input $a$ and $b$ respectively.

<img src="/assets/ctf-stuff/2025-dicectf/gc.png" alt="gc" style="zoom: 85%;" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>


Alice and Bob agree on the pubic $f$ and its corresponding boolean circuit $\mathcal{F}$. Let the private input $a = (a_1, \ldots, a_{m})$ and $b = (b_1, \ldots, b_{n})$.

1. **Circuit Garbling**: Alice garbles the public boolean circuit $\mathcal{F}$, i.e., encrypting the truth table and wire labels. Denote the  truth tables of the garbled circuit as $\mathcal{F}_{g}$. In this case, every input wire is encoded as two strings $w_0, w_1$ representing input bit $0,1$ respectively.
2. **OT Phase**: Alice sends wire labels corresponding to Bob's private input $b$ through a batch of OT protocols. The other wire labels must kept secret to Bob.
3. Alice sends the garbled circuit $\mathcal{F}_{g}$ (truth tables of all gates) and wire labels corresponding to Alice's private input to Bob. Note that the wire labels looks random and leaks nothing about $a$ to Bob.
4. **Evaluation**: Bob now has all input wire labels and garbled truth tables $\mathcal{F}_{g}$ and evaluate the circuit to obtain the final encrypted output. 
5. **Reveal Output**: Since Bob does not know which bit semantic the final output wire label corresponds to, Alice and Bob exchange information to learn the plain output of the the pubic $f$.

The above protocol is too high-level and in the following, we elaborate on how to garble a boolean gate.


<section class="info" markdown="1">

**Circuit Garbling**

To garble a circuit, we must garble both the wires and truth table of all gates.

- **Wire**: Alice assigns each wire in the circuit (**a wire represents an input or output**) two randomly generated strings, called **labels**: one representing the Boolean semantic 0, and the other representing 1. The length of each label is $k$ bits, where $k$ is the security parameter e.g. $k = 128$. Now, all the wires input/output of circuit $\mathcal{F}$ are random labels.
- **Truth Table**: Every gate can be represented as a truth table. Alice replaces the 0 and 1 in the truth table of each logic gate in the circuit with the corresponding labels. 

For example, we garble the **AND** gate as follows:

<img src="/assets/ctf-stuff/2025-dicectf/and-gate.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="and-gate" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

The semantic truth table and labeled truth table are as follows (actually $f$ can be any fan-in-2 gate here):

| a    | b    | **f(a,b)** |      | a       | b       | **f(a,b)** |
| ---- | ---- | ---------- | ---- | ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 0    | 0    | 0          |      | $X_a^0$ | $X_b^0$ | $X_c^0$    |
| 0    | 1    | 0          |      | $X_a^0$ | $X_b^0$ | $X_c^0$    |
| 1    | 0    | 0          |      | $X_a^1$ | $X_b^0$ | $X_c^0$    |
| 1    | 1    | 1          |      | $X_a^1$ | $X_b^1$ | $X_c^1$    |

Alice needs additional encryption to prevent inferring the 0 or 1 bit semantics represented by the labels from the garbled truth table. Alice then **encrypts the output entries of the truth table using the corresponding two input labels. The encrypted table is called the garbled table.** This ensures that one can only decrypt the garbled table item when possessing the correct two input labels. In the table below, $Enc_{k_1, k_2}(x)$ represents a dual-key symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., two keys are used to encrypt twice).

| **Garbled Table**                      |
| -------------------------------------- |
| $Enc_{X_{a}^{0},X_{b}^{0}}(X_{c}^{0})$ |
| $Enc_{X_{a}^{0},X_{b}^{1}}(X_{c}^{0})$ |
| $Enc_{X_{a}^{1},X_{b}^{0}}(X_{c}^{0})$ |
| $Enc_{X_{a}^{1},X_{b}^{1}}(X_{c}^{1})$ |

After this, Alice randomly shuffles the above garbled table, making it impossible to determine the output bit from the order of the rows. **To make sure Bob gets the correct wire, the construction must use an encryption scheme that makes it obvious when decrypting the "correct" ciphertext.**
</section>


Now, we can see that with only the input wires and the garbled circuit $\mathcal{F}_{g}$ (truth tables of all gates), Bob can evaluate the circuit recursively and finally get the labels of output wires. After the evaluation, Bob obtains the output labels denoted as $X^{c}$ (assuming the circuit outputs only one bit), and Alice knows its mapping to the boolean value because the labels were initialized by her. Either Alice can share her information with Bob, or Bob can reveal the output to Alice, allowing one or both of them to learn the output.


### A Demo of Garbled Circuit 

In DiceCTF 2021, there is challenge [garbled](https://github.com/dicegang/dicectf-2021-challenges/tree/master/crypto/garbled) (writeup can be found [here](https://ctftime.org/writeup/25974)) about the naive implementation of Yao's garbled circuit. I use the challenge codes to illustrate the steps of garbled circuit protocol. The demo codes can be found in my [ctf-writeups](https://github.com/tl2cents/CTF-Writeups/tree/master/2025/DiceCTF/nic-cir/demo).


<section class="success" markdown="1">
**Step 0. Public Circuit and Private Inputs**

Alice and Bob agree on the pubic boolean circuit $\mathcal{F}$ defined as follows:

``` json
# circuit_map.json
{
 "inputs" : [1, 2, 3, 4],
 "out" : [9],
 "gates" : [
     {"id" : 5, "type" : "AND", "in" : [1, 2]},
     {"id" : 6, "type" : "AND", "in" : [3, 4]},
     {"id" : 7, "type" : "AND", "in" : [5, 6]},
     {"id" : 9, "type" : "XOR", "in" : [7, 4]}
 ]
}
```

Alice's input values corresponding to wires 1 and 2: $x_1, x_2$, while Bob's input values corresponding to wires 3 and 4: $x_3, x_4$. The function represented by the circuit is:

$$
f(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = f(a, b) = ((x_1 \& x_2) \& (x_3 \& x_4)) \oplus x_4
$$

Given:

- Alice’s private input: $a = (x_1, x_2) = (1, 0)$.  
- Bob’s private input: $b = (x_3, x_4) = (1, 1)$.

<section class="success" markdown="1">
**Step 1. Wire Generations and Garbling**

Alice runs [gen_key.py](https://github.com/tl2cents/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/2025/DiceCTF/nic-cir/demo/gen_key.py) and gets the label pairs of all 9 wires. They are called the private keys in th code:

``` python
keys = {
1: (15233817, 1315943), 
2: (15274501, 5158879), 
3: (7431802, 16682547), 
4: (11945610, 6753699), 
5: (13849459, 4637545), 
6: (10453495, 2479542), 
7: (2068375, 13039971), 
9: (7508273, 12723289)}
```

where $keys[i][b]$ is the label representing the bit $b$ of wire $i$. Alice also generates a garbled table:

``` python
G_Table = {
5: [(6829921, 11451673), (1515696, 6333149), (15107502, 8186257), (5872557, 12241756)], 
6: [(13415489, 4332242), (5144037, 9578022), (15201634, 13202380), (10357348, 15158424)], 
7: [(1587462, 6581034), (8356378, 2216472), (11762280, 3875959), (5982650, 7776773)], 
9: [(5728291, 11896856), (12052243, 1282564), (10228672, 10487067), (6137078, 8217550)]}
```

where `G_Table[i]` is the shuffled truth table of gate with id $i$. Alice sends the garbled table `G_Table` and labels of her private input: $L_{a}  = (x_1^1,x_2^0) = (key[1][1],key[2][0]) = (1315943 ,15274501)$ to Bob.

**Remarks**

In this case, the item $f(a, b) = c$ of truth table  is encrypted as follows:

``` python
def encrypt(data, key1, key2):
    encrypted = encrypt_data(data, key1)
    encrypted = encrypt_data(encrypted, key2)
    return encrypted

def garble_label(key0, key1, key2):
    """
    key0, key1 = two input labels of a, b
    key2 = output label of c
    """
    gl = encrypt(key2, key0, key1)
    validation = encrypt(0, key0, key1)
    return (gl, validation)
```

The tuple $(g, v)$ actually encrypts an extra value $0$ for validation and Bob can find the correct output label of $c$ by checking whether the the second plaintext is zero.

<section class="success" markdown="1">
**Step 2. Oblivious Transfer + Evaluation**

In this step, Bob learns the labels of his private input: 

$$
L_{b} = (x_3^1,x_4^1) = (key[3][1],key[4][1]) = (16682547, 6753699)
$$

without revealing anything about $b = (1, 1)$ through the OT protocol. We will not explain the details of OT protocol here, readers can refer to [OT-WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivious_transfer) for more details. The simplest OT protocol can be instantiated from RSA (or ECDH, see [eprint/2015/267](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/267)).

At this point, Bob has all the input wire labels and the garbled truth tables of the circuit, so he can begin computing the labels corresponding to the output wires. Specifically, the process involves unlocking the four entries in the garbled truth table corresponding to each logic gate. Among these entries, only one is the correct result, enabling Bob to obtain the intermediate labels of $x_5, x_6, x_7, x_9$. The label $x_9$ represents the final computation result.

Then Bob learns that the target label is $12723289$, but he does not know whether this label corresponds to a 0 or 1 bit of $x_9$. Alice can further reveals the bit semantic of $12723289$ to Bob (or the labels of $x_9$ can be committed at first).

## Elementary Optimizations

In Yao's garbled circuit, every fan-in-k gate needs $2^k$ ciphertexts to encrypt the truth table. Besides, the encrypted truth table must be shuffled and the evaluator is expected to try $2^{k-1}$ item decryptions to find the correct output wire label.  Therefore, the early implementations of garbled circuits were extremely slow. With the emergence of numerous optimization techniques, garbled circuits have now reached practical application standards.

<section class="info" markdown="1">
**Point-and-Permute [BMR90](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/100216.100287)**

A random "color bit" is appended to each wire label, so that the pair labels $(W_i^{0}, W_i^1)$ for wire $i$ have opposite color bits, i.e., $\mathcal{LSB}(W_i^0) = b, \mathcal{LSB}(W_i^1) = 1-b$. The color bit $b$ is randomly assigned and thus we can arrange the 4 ciphertexts according to color bits of the input wire labels (i.e., the first ciphertext should be the one that uses two keys having both 0 color bits, regardless of what truth value they represent). In this case, the evaluator need only decrypt one ciphertext — the one indicated by the color bits of the input wire labels.

</section>

&nbsp;

<section class="info" markdown="1">
**Row Reduction [NPS99](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/336992.337028)**

When point-and-permute is applied, we can use simple one-time encryption for garbling the truth table:

$$
E_{k_1, k_2}(m) = \mathcal{H}(g, k_1 \mid\mid k_2) \oplus m
$$

where $\mathcal{H}$ is a random oracle. When garbling a gate $G(W_a, W_b)= W_c$, we can choose the two outputs $W_c^0, W_k^1$ labels such that the first ciphertext is zero. Assume that first gate ciphertext is (we treat the superscript of the wires as a color bit here):

$$
E_{W_a^0, W_b^0}(W_c^0) = \mathcal{H}(g, W_a^0 \mid\mid W_b^0) \oplus W_c^0.
$$

We then assign $W_c^0 = \mathcal{H}(g, W_a^0 \mid\mid W_b^0) $ and only three ciphertexts of fan-in-2 gates are sent to the evaluator. We can futher reduce the number of ciphertexts to 2 by polynomial interpolation in [PSSW09](https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/314.pdf) or a simple construction in [GLNP15](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/751.pdf). Since the two techniques are not compatible with free-XOR, we will not discuss them here.

</section>
&nbsp;

<section class="info" markdown="1">
**Free-XOR [KS08](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vlad/papers/XOR_ICALP08.pdf)**

The free-XOR optimization has the highest practical impact on garbled circuit, which makes the XOR gate be free of cost. In free XOR, the garbler will generate a global secret value $\Delta \in \{0,1 \}^{\lambda}$ and the wire labels are chosen such that $W_i^{0} \oplus W_i^1 = \Delta$. This can be rewritten as $W_i^{x} = W_i^{0} \oplus (x\Delta)$ and for an XOR gate $G(W_a, W_b)= W_c$, we have:

$$
W_a^x \oplus W_b^y = (W_a^0 \oplus W_b^0) \oplus (x \oplus y) \Delta
$$

We assign $W_c^0 = W_a^0 \oplus W_b^0$ as the 'false' wire label and simply XORing two input wire labels of XOR gate that encodes $a, b$ results in the output wire label encoding $c = a \oplus b$. As a consequence, garbled XOR gate can be evaluated without any cryptographic operations by the evaluator or any garbled-gate information in the garbled circuit. Note that by choosing $\mathcal{LSB}(\Delta) = 1$ (or other definition of the color bit), the free-XOR technique is compatible of point-and-permute and row-reduction techniques, which results in 3 ciphertexts per AND gate and 0 per XOR.
</section>
&nbsp;


## Half-Gate Technique

The half-gate technique **[ZRE15](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/756)** is a powerful optimization that allows the use of only two ciphertexts per AND, OR, NOR, NAND gate, while being compatible with free-XOR, which results in two ciphertexts per AND/OR gate and 0 per XOR gate. Later in CRYPTO'21, Mike Rosulek and Lawrence Roy [RR21](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/749.pdf) improved the half-gate technique, allowing 1.5 ciphertexts per AND gate and 0 per XOR gate. This section involves only techniques introduced in [ZRE15](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/756).


### Half-Gate Decomposition

The half-gate technique allows two ciphertexts per AND gate which is compatible of free-XOR. Denote $(A, A \oplus \Delta)$ and $(B, B \oplus \Delta)$ as the input wire labels to an AND gate, and $(C, C \oplus \Delta)$ as the output wire labels, where $A, B, C$ each encodes 'false' (bit 0) of $a, b, c$. Let $\mathcal{H}(\cdot)$ be a random oracle. The half-gate technique split the AND gate $c = a \land b$ as follows:

- Case $a = 0$: AND gate degenerate to a unary gate that always outputs false.
- Case $a = 1$: AND gate degenerate to a unary identity gate that always outputs its input.

Now, note that the AND gate can be split into two half gate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
c &= a \land b  \\
&= a \land (r \oplus r \oplus b) \\
& = (a  \land r) \oplus (a \land (r \oplus b))
\end{aligned}
$$

Suppose the generator chooses a uniformly random bit $r$ and the bit $r$ is known to the generator. In practical case, the generator will choose $r$ to be the color bit of the false wire label on wire $b$ which reveals the value of $r \oplus b$ to the evaluator because for wire $W_i^b$, its color bit is exactly $r \oplus b$. In the following, we consider two half AND gates where exactly one input is known to either the garbler or evaluator.

<section class="info" markdown="1">
**Generator Half-Gate.** In the generator's view, the bit $r$ is known. The generator generates the following two ciphertexts to evaluate $a \land r$:

$$
\begin{cases}
\mathcal{H}(A) \oplus C \\
\mathcal{H}(A \oplus \Delta) \oplus C \oplus r\Delta
\end{cases}
$$

These are then suitably permuted according to the color bits of $A$. The evaluator decrypts this by hashing the wire label for $A$. If $r = 0$, the evaluator always gets $C$ (zero bit of output). If $r = 1$, the evaluator gets either $C$ or $C \oplus \Delta$ corresponding the bit of $a$. We can further apply the row-reduction technique. We choose $C$  (as $\mathcal{H}(B), \mathcal{H}(B \oplus R)$ or $\mathcal{H}(B \oplus R) \oplus R$ depending on the color bits and the value of $r$) such that the first of the two ciphertexts is the all-zero ciphertext.
</section>
&nbsp;

<section class="info" markdown="1">
**Evaluator Half-Gate.** In the evaluator's view, the value of color bit denoted as $s := r \oplus b$ is known.  When $s = 0$, the evaluator should always obtain output wire label $C$ (zero bit). When $s = 1$, it's enough for the evaluator to obtain $C \oplus A$. In can then XOR $C \oplus A$ with its label of $a$ (either $A$ or $A \oplus \Delta$) to get the correct output as $C$ or $C \oplus \Delta$.  In the generator's view, it knows the value of $r$, therefore, we denote the symbol $S$ as the label wire of $s$:

$$
S = \begin{cases}
B, & r = 0 \\
B \oplus \Delta, &r = 1
\end{cases}
$$

The generator generates the following two ciphertexts for the evaluator to evaluate $a \land (r \oplus b) = a \land s$:

$$
\begin{cases}
G_1 = \mathcal{H}(S) \oplus C \\
G_2 = \mathcal{H}(S \oplus \Delta) \oplus C \oplus A
\end{cases}
$$

The ciphertexts do not have to be permuted here. They can be arranged according to the truth value of $s$ as shown here, since the evaluator already knows $s$. In the evaluator's side, it computes the output label based on the value of $s$ and label $S \oplus s \Delta$:

$$
\begin{cases}
s = 0: &G_1 \oplus \mathcal{H}(S \oplus s \Delta) = C \\
s = 1: &G_2 \oplus \mathcal{H}(S \oplus s \Delta) \oplus A \oplus a \Delta = C \oplus a \Delta \\
\end{cases}
$$

This shows that we can correctly evaluate the half gate. Again, we can remove the first ciphertext using garbled row-reduction. We choose $C = \mathcal{H}(S)$ so that the first ciphertext becomes all-zeroes and is not sent to the evaluator.
</section>

Now, two halves make a whole ADD gate. We denote $C_{G}, C_{E}$ as the generator's and evaluator's half gates, respectively. Intuitively, we can XOR the two ciphertexts of half gates to obtain the ciphertexts of the original AND gate. 

### Two Halves = One Whole

Let the AND gate's input labels be $W_a^{0}, W_a^{1}, W_b^{0}, W_b^{1}$ and output labels $W_{c}^0, W_{c}^1$. Let $W_{G_c}, W_{G_e}$ be the output labels of generator's and evaluator's half-gates. The global offset value for free-XOR is $\Delta$, i.e., $W_{i}^{0} \oplus W_{i}^{1} = \Delta$ for all $i$. Denote the color bits of $W_a^{0}, W_a^{1}$ as $p_a$ and $p_b$ respectively.

After row-reduction and permutation (according color bits $p_a, 1 \oplus p_a$, we assume $p_a$ = 0 here for simplicity), the generator assigns

$$
T_{G_c} = \mathcal{H}(W_a^1) \oplus  \mathcal{H}(W_a^0)  \oplus p_b \Delta

<section class="success" markdown="1">
**Step 3 Combine Two Halves.** The generator sends the garbled truth table items $T_{G_c}, T_{E_c}$ to the evaluator. The generator XORs the two output labels of half-gates to obtain the output label of the original AND gate:

$$
W_{c}^{0} := W_{E_c}^0 \oplus W_{G_c}^0 = \mathcal{H}(W_a^0) \oplus \mathcal{H}(W_b^{p_b})
$$

</section>

Finally, the generator sends $T_{G_c}, T_{G_e}$ to the evaluator. Denote the boolean value of wire $a, b$ as $x_{a}, x_{b}$ and let $p_a$ be $0$ for simplicity (ignore the first permutation). The evaluator evaluate the two half gates to get $W_{G_c}, W_{E_c}$ based on the color bits of $W_a^{x_a}, W_b^{x_b}$ as follows:

$$
\begin{cases}
W_{G_c} &= \mathcal{H}(W_{a}^{x_a}) \oplus x_a T_{G_c} \\
&= x_a\mathcal{H}(W_{a}^{1}) \oplus (x_a \oplus 1)\mathcal{H}(W_{a}^{0}) \oplus x_a(\mathcal{H}(W_a^1) \oplus  \mathcal{H}(W_a^0)  \oplus p_b \Delta)\\ 
&= \mathcal{H}(W_a^0) \oplus (x_a p_b) \Delta\\
&= W_{G_c}^{x_a p_b} \\
W_{E_{c}} &= \mathcal{H}(W_{b}^{x_{b}}) \oplus (p_b \oplus x_b) (T_{E_c} \oplus W_{a}^{x_{a}}) \\
&=  x_b\mathcal{H}(W_{b}^{1}) \oplus (x_b \oplus 1)\mathcal{H}(W_{b}^{0}) \oplus (p_b \oplus x_b)(\mathcal{H}(W_b^{1}) \oplus \mathcal{H}(W_{b}^0) \oplus W_{a}^0 \oplus W_{a}^{x_{a}}) \\
&= p_b \mathcal{H}(W_{b}^{1}) \oplus ( p_b \oplus 1)\mathcal{H}(W_{b}^{0}) \oplus (p_b \oplus x_b)x_a \Delta \\
&= \mathcal{H}(W_{b}^{p_b}) \oplus (p_b \oplus x_b)x_a \Delta \\
&= W_{E_c}^{ x_a(p_b \oplus x_b)}
\end{cases}
$$

Use the free-XOR to get the final output label as

$$
W_c = W_{G_c} \oplus W_{E_c} = W_{c}^{x_a p_b \oplus x_a p_b \oplus x_a x_b} = W_c^{x_a x_b}.
$$

This shows our scheme evaluates the ADD gate correctly with only two ciphertexts using free-XOR. This half-gates can generalize to any gate whose truth table contains an odd number of ones (e.g. AND, NAND, OR, NOR, etc.). All such gates can be expressed as the form of

$$
f(v_a, v_b) = (\alpha_a \oplus v_a) \land (\alpha_b \oplus v_b) \oplus \alpha_c
$$

for constants $\alpha_a, \alpha_b, \alpha_c$. The generic half gates can be described as follows:

**Typo: In generator's half-gate, the value $p_b$ is known to generator.**

**Arithmetic Garbled Circuits [BMR16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/969)**

The BMR16 scheme generalizes the free-XOR and half-gates to arithmetic circuits (vectors modular $n$),  resulting in garbled circuits with free addition, weighted threshold gates with cost independent of fan-in, and exponentiation by a fixed exponent with cost independent of the exponent. Specifically, BMR16 gives an exponential improvement over the state of the art for threshold gates (including AND/OR gates) of high fan-in. The [fancy-garbling](https://github.com/GaloisInc/swanky/tree/dev/fancy-garbling) library implements a really fast version of BMR16 with additional optimizations. We omit details of BMR16 here since most of the techniques have been introduced above.

## Free-XOR Offset Leak

When free-XOR is implemented in garbled circuit, it should be careful that an malicious OT receiver may destroy the security and privacy of garbled circuit. In standard OT protocol, although it's impossible (when implemented and used correctly) for the receiver to obtain two messages $x_0, x_1$ simultaneously, a dishonest receiver may carefully construct the input so that the value of some function $f(x_0, x_1)$ is leaked (e.g., we can easily recover the value of  $f(x_0, x_1) = x_0 \pm x_1 \mod N$ in the RSA OT protocol). In free-XOR, the two messages to be transmitted in OT protocol) are $W_i^0, W_i^{1}$ where $\Delta = W_i^0 \oplus W_i^{1}$ holds for all $i$. Therefore, if we can recover $f(W_i^0, W_i^{1}) = W_i^0 \oplus W_i^{1} = \Delta$, we can actually recover all labels in the circuit. 

In challenge [NIL-CIRC](https://github.com/defund/ctf/tree/master/dicectf-quals-2025/nil-circ), the Chou-Orlandi OT protocol is implemented in fancy-garbling library. We can recover the server's private key as follows:

- Run the Chou-Orlandi OT protocol with an malicious receiver. This can leak the global offset $\Delta$ of free-XOR which allows us to recover all the wire label pairs in the garbled circuit.
- Use the unbalanced AND gate to recover the bit semantics of wire label pairs. 
- Construct linear equations to recover the private key bits based on the bit semantics of wire labels.

### Chou-Orlandi OT protocol

The Chou-Orlandi OT protocol [eprint/2015/267](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/267) is claimed to be UC-secure in the random oracle model under dynamic corruptions.

<section class="warning" markdown="1">
**OT Based on ECDH**

The sender has two secrets $m_0, m_1$. Let $G$ be the public generator on curve-25519 and $q$ be the order of $G$. All the arithmetic operations are performed over curve-25519. Denote $\mathcal{H}$ as a random oracle. The Chou-Orlandi OT protocol runs as follows:

- The sender samples $y \in_{R} \mathbb{Z}_{q}$ and sends $Y= y \cdot G$ to the receiver.

- The receiver samples $r \in_{R} \mathbb{Z}_{q}$ and chooses a challenge based on his secret bit $b$.
  
  $$
  R = \begin{cases}
  r \cdot G, & b= 0 \\
  Y - r \cdot G, & b= 1
  \end{cases}
  $$
  
  Save $k_b = \mathcal{H}(i,  r \cdot Y)$ where $i$ is a counter for performing batch OT protocols and send $R$ to the sender.
 
- The server computes two one-time keys:
  
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  k_0 = \mathcal{H}(i, y R) \\
  k_1 = \mathcal{H}(i, yY - yR) \\
  \end{cases}
  $$
  
  and encrypts the two messages:
  
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  c_0 = m_0 \oplus k_0 \\
  c_1 = m_1 \oplus k_1 \\
  \end{cases}
  $$
  
  Send pair $(c_0, c_1)$ to the receiver.

- Note that:
  
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  b=0: & k_0 = \mathcal{H}(i, yr \cdot G) = k_b \\
  b=1: & k_1 = \mathcal{H}(i, yY - yY + yR) = k_b \\
  \end{cases}
  $$
  
  The receiver retrieves his message $m_b$ as follows:
  
  $$
  m_b = c_b \oplus k_b
  $$
</section>

This is a perfect phase to run a malicious OT receiver attack to recover the global offset $\Delta$ of free-XOR. The idea to make:

$$
k_0 = k_1 \implies yR = y Y - yR  \implies R = \frac{1}{2}Y.
$$

When receiving any input wire label $W_i^{b}$, the malicious receiver can recover:

$$
\Delta = c_0 \oplus c_1 = m_0 \oplus m_1 = W_{i}^0 \oplus W_{i}^{1}.
$$

For all other OT protocols, the malicious receiver runs honestly. With $\Delta$ and free-XOR, the attacker can recover both labels for each wire.

### Recovering Private Inputs

No matter what optimizations are applied, the real truth table remains the same to keep the functionality. Therefore, we can distinguish the bit semantics represented by the wire labels from **an unbalanced truth table**.  For a balanced gate such as XOR, we cannot decide the bit semantics of wire labels from a shuffled truth table. Take the AND gate as an example. Let the input wires be $W_{a}^{x}, W_{a}^{y}$ and $W_{b}^{u}, W_{b}^{v}$. Given the garbled circuit, we can evaluate the AND gate four times using input pairs:

$$
(W_a^x, W_b^u),(W_a^x, W_b^v), (W_a^y, W_b^u),(W_a^y, W_b^v)
$$

and will only obtain two output labels $W_c^{0}, W_c^{1}$. We can determine that the output label occurring thrice is the label $W_c^0$ representing 'false' semantics and the other occurring once is the label $W_c^1$ representing 'true' semantics. Supposing the two labels $W_a^x, W_b^{v}$ outputs the $W_c^{1}$, we then know $W_a^1 = W_a^x$ and $W_b^1 = W_b^v$, respectively.

If we have the garbled circuit and all the input label pairs $(W_i^0, W_{i}^1)$ with their bit semantics unknown, we then evaluate the whole gates using arbitrary input $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$. When it comes to an AND gate, we have two input labels $W_0, W_1$. Using free-XOR, we reconstruct the four input wire labels as $(W_{0}, W_{0} \oplus \Delta)$ and $(W_{1}, W_{1} \oplus \Delta)$ and evaluate the table four times to determine the bit semantics of $W_0, W_1$. Meanwhile, since the circuit is public, we know the algebraic expression (polynomial) of wires related to $W_0$ and $W_1$ and build an equation of original inputs $(x_1, \cdots, x_n)$. Collect enough equations and solves for $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ corresponding to our evaluated labels. Recall that we use one OT (e.g. input $0$) to recover the offset $\Delta$, all the wires related to input 0 will be ignored during evaluation. We can redefine a `leaky_and` evaluation in fancy-garbling:

``` rust
impl<C: AbstractChannel> CustomAND for Evaluator<C, WireMod2> {
    // returns (output_label, A_bit, B_bit, success) where A_bit, B_bit are the bit semantics of A, B. 
    // `success` indicates whether the leak sucesses.
    fn leaky_and(&mut self, A: &Self::Item, B: &Self::Item, delta: &Self::Item) -> Result<(Self::Item, bool, bool, bool), Self::Error> {
        let gate0 = self.channel.read_block()?;
        let gate1 = self.channel.read_block()?;
        let A_inv = A.plus(delta);
        let B_inv = B.plus(delta);
        let inputs = [
            (A, B),
            (A, &B_inv),
            (&A_inv, B),
            (&A_inv, &B_inv),
        ];
        
        let outs = inputs.iter().map(|(a, b)| {
            let res = self.evaluate_and_gate(a, b, &gate0, &gate1);
            self.current_gate -= 1;
            res
        }).collect::<Vec<_>>();
        self.current_gate += 1;

        if outs[0] == outs[1] && outs[0] == outs[2] {
            return Ok((outs[0], false, false, true));
        } else if outs[0] == outs[1] && outs[0] == outs[3] {
            return Ok((outs[0], false, true, true));
        } else if outs[0] == outs[2] && outs[0] == outs[3] {
            return Ok((outs[0], true, false, true));
        } else if outs[1] == outs[2] && outs[1] == outs[3] {
            return Ok((outs[0], true, true, true));
        }
        // If we get here, we have a wrong label or a wrong gate, or a wrong delta
        return Ok((outs[0], false, false, false));
    }
}
```

Then we export all known bits of the wires into a file and solve linear equations to recover key bits in sagemath. In my local test, we can recover 124 key bits and brute force 4 bits to decrypt the flag. Exploiting codes can be found in my [ctf-writeups](https://github.com/tl2cents/CTF-Writeups/tree/master/2025/DiceCTF/nic-cir).
